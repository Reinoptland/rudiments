# Rudiments

This is repo which contains basic JavaScript exercises with jest tests.

## How to run

- Run `npm install`
- Pick an exercise (a file with .test.js)
- Remove `.skip` from the describe block
- Run `npm run test:watch` in the terminal
- If you are just starting with JS passing the first test already very good!
- When the basic test case is passing, remove `.skip` from the `BONUS` test cases for an extra challenge!

## How to check your work

- If the tests pass, your solution works
